## 🐄 **Empowering Farmers with Real-Time Cattle Health Monitoring**

In rural communities, farmers rely on livestock not just for income—but for survival.  
Yet most of them don’t have the tools to detect when cattle are stressed, sick, or in danger—until it’s too late. Manual monitoring is slow, error-prone, and frankly, not scalable.

We built **CattlePlus** to change that. It's a rugged, low-power IoT hub that uses smart sensors and local AI to monitor cattle health in real time—even with little to no internet.  
Designed for real-world use, CattlePlus focuses on what's *essential*: affordability, offline support, and actionable insights at the farm level.

## ✅ Our Solution
We provide smart, affordable, wearable sensor devices paired with local AI processing to monitor cattle and aquatic animal health. Our open-source system supports:

- Activity tracking & lameness detection  
- Bioacoustics-based stress detection  
- Cow identification & disease detection  
- Skin disease and bite/chew classification  
- SMS alerts and mobile app interface (Flutter)

This system works in offline/online modes using Raspberry Pi or E2E cloud nodes, ensuring inclusivity and scalability.
